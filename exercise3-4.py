#3-4 Guest list: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three poeple you'd like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

guest_list = ['Samuel', 'Daniel', 'Jose']
print("Hello " + guest_list[0] + " you're invited to my dinner!")
print("Hello " + guest_list[1] + " you're invited to my dinner!")
print("Hello " + guest_list[2] + " you're invited to my dinner!")
