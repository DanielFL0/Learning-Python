#2-3 Personal Message: Store a person's name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, "Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?".

#In this exercise first I declare and instantiate a name variable with a String data type that contains my name on it, then I declare and instantiate a message variable with a String data type that concatenates in between the strings "Hello " and ", would you like to learn some Python today?"
name = "Daniel"
message = "Hello " + name + ", would you like to learn some Python today?"
print(message)
